**Teacher's Notes:**


Behaviour Trees / Waypoint Pathfinder

case 7 is used to test for Unity's NavMesh (pathfinding feature is the only function which is enabled)

Placeholder project, if I have time in the summer, I'll resubmit a project that is related to Content Generation.

No changes with the AI except for adding a new pathfinding method to the system

Unity version: Unity 2017.1.0f3 (64-bit)


**Notes:**


Uses the coursework from 'Lab 1: Behaviour Trees' - http://gitlab.doc.gold.ac.uk/jbanh010/Lab-1-Behaviour-Trees

Uses the Unity's NavMesh.

Project is sadly not self-contained.



**Testing:**


use behaviour 7 to test the functionality of the unity's NavMesh implementation

Edit Behaviours.cs line:618-619 if you want to compare the First generation the pathfinding with NavMesh. - https://gyazo.com/61566dcc4a3225bf76dcaf892869625a
